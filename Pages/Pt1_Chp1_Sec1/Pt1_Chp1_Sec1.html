It is, for the most part, a very typical transporter, doing a very common job, on a very average cycle. This transporter has just begun its approximately cycle-long journey of collecting new recruits for the Soli fleet. These recruits will spend the next two sols of their lives on a planet referred to as HRDF-1: short for Human/Risonoid world 1. This planet, a small planet in the inner system of Helio-Rae, is a highly populated planet. </span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span>Unlike Altas-Minas, this transporter&rsquo;s current stop, HRDF-1 is not a resource colony.

Though they were the blob&rsquo;s strongest of children, soon the known blob would no longer house their kind. Their numbers had dwindled significantly during the dark revelations brought about by the False War the previous war-time, and genetic warfare of the rust-waters. Despite this, they still dedicated themselves to an important purpose in this blob during the Great Exile: assisting with the protection of the blob, and the eventual passage of it to the younger species which populated it</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">(Laerets, Matiran, and Humans).</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c4">Returning to our story, this transporter has just arrived in Tres&rsquo;Valinas, a long, troubled, and lawless mining settlement on the Altas-Minas equator.

Though not an illegal hybrid, Hezek, for most of his life, was considered a second-class mutt. A dirty, unfortunate, and disgusting hybrid to the rugged inhabitants of Tres&rsquo;Valinas. Terrens and Soli, you see, were not encouraged to cross-breed with one another any longer. Their cross breeding would only further accelerate, and subsequently doom, the two sister species&rsquo;s series of manufactured genetic defects known as </span><span class="c9">rust-water</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">mutations</span><span class="c4">.

He would not have been selected for recruitment by the Soli fleet, if it hadn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span>Meanwhile, his ally and compatriot, Voli (the taller of the two) was a prime example of a </span><span class="c9">male rust-water mutant</span><span>. Though breyline overabundance (exhibited by his crystalline subdermal markings) was not </span><span class="c9">unnatural</span><span>&nbsp;amongst soli males (albeit certainly rare anymore), breyline overabundance to the extent at which Voli exhibited was </span><span class="c9">very much</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a rust-water mutation.

Because of this, they had grown friendly with one another, and had subsequently applied to the fleet in unison. By consequence, they were also recruited by the fleet&hellip; in unison.

Thinking Ela, who keeps her face lowered, is a normal (albeit short) sel with perhaps little interest in speaking to others, Zak eagerly sits beside her.</span></p><p class="c0 c5 c8"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Another stationer goes to enter the ship shortly after ZAK, but after glancing around the vessel, quickly ducks out to go to a different transport.

All unfamiliar, and admittedly a bit intimidating in their gruffness.</span></p><p class="c3 c5 c8"><span class="c4">In opposition: Zak&rsquo;s pale complexion and light blue eyes immediately attracts the attention of the transporter&#39;s occupants. Not because they are also intrigued by his appearance, though. They, instead, are loathsome. Zak stands as a symbol to a much simpler, dauntingly luxurious life that none of them were so lucky to be born into. He is weak in their eyes, a sad example of what has become of their species, and a spawn of cowards who left their forefathers to suffer during the beginnings of the False War.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">We look around with ZAK now, seeing the many faces that look back at him. As ZAK&rsquo;s eyes fall onto them, many of the land-colonists avert their gaze. Three Soli land-colonists keep their eyes fixated on ZAK, though, prompting him to avert his gaze instead. We see the cabin, and its occupants rock softly from side to side as the transporter&rsquo;s engines engage, and it leaves the station.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">NARRATOR</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c4">Simply because of their fatigue, and their presence in an unfamiliar place, many of the land-dwellers do nothing more than stare at him.
